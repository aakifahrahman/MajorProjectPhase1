I really enjoyed this book. I don't believe that my review can add much value on top of the other reviews, but maybe I can entice a few of you to buy it.
I have read the book twice now, which I think is required (at minimum) to really absorb everything. I see that Aaron's review got 2 out of 5, and I am a bit perplexed, because his is succinct and accurate. Oh well, you can't win 'um all. One pro is that the book is written in an entertaining way. Half the chapters are a story with a lesson, and the other half is math. Together they read like some popular books that are out now, like Havil's "Gamma", or "Euler" by Dunham: it reads like a book, but with equations everywhere. It is the half way point between a publication and a novel. If you are a masters in finance or an MBA, with no real math background, this might be distracting and halting, but to a quant it should cut like butter.
My only complaint, and this might not be a complaint but, rather, an aversion to suspense, is that there are certain thoughts that aren't completed. As interesting as the read is, I feel like it is almost a cliffhanger; baiting for books to come? I don't think this was deliberate. Some thoughts, while they began with fireworks, just petered out.
Also, it is a bit expensive but, hey, most of us aren't paying for this and, at a minimum, writing it off ;-) (Sorry to any students out there, I owe you a drink)
