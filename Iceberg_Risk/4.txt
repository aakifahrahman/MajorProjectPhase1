Just finishing this now, the running narrative is a welcome distraction from the material, which is hit and miss. The second half (more proscriptive) is better in general than the first, which is a pretty tortuous journey though non-Gaussian probability. It is a strange book, the math makes it unapproachable to the layperson, but the colloquial prose makes it a bit tedious as a technical read. Still, there are some good parts, enough that I will likely hang on to it for a while in case I need to refer to them.
