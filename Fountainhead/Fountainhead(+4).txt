I first read The Fountainhead as a junior for my English research paper. I was skeptical about such a large book, and my attitude toward reading it was likewise. However, after reading it the first time, I could not stop talking about the intense philosophy Ayn Rand introduces with Howard Roark. The idea of Objectivism, essentially the glorification of individual man's prominence, is intriguing and worthy of consideration. I love the character of Howard Roark because he is the perfect example of a man who becomes successful despite the restraining presence of a society bent on the normal. Our greatest historical thinkers were Howard Roarks: Galileo, Einstein, Newton, and the list goes on and on. This book, although fictional, gives proof to the reader that mankind has the desire to move forward regardless of other people. I see Roark not as a depressed and pitiful weakling who blames society for the downfall of man, but as a true hero among men. He stands out because he does not fold under the pressure of the majority; he does not bail out on the obvious answer when he knows a deeper meaning exists. Now, I am reading the book again, one year later, and I find myself underlining most parts of the book. The story line is filled with true-to-life situations; social Darwinism, society v. man, revenge, desire, lust, and every other symptom of life the reader could think of. The Fountainhead is truly more than a classic, and it is worth reading time and time again. The more it is read, the more the reader knows about the idea of Objectivism and how accurately it pertains to the life of mankind. This is definitely a five-star reader, and I encourage everyone to give it a look.
