 It is just too long and wordy, and the same ideas could have been expressed in half the number of pages.
The storyline borders on the ridiculous and extra-ordinary coincidences throughout the book, and I had to wade through 400 pages of boring text and dialogue before the point was expressed in the end.
2 stars because of the ideas in the book, but otherwise, if you have read the back page and the summary in Amazon.com, then you have gotten the idea.
