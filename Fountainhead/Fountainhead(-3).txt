 A poorly written book, by a potentially good writer. Too driven by the need to express her 'philosophy', Rand sacrifices all character and plot credibility on the altar of the idea. This idea is not interesting enough to overcome the paucity of characterization and situation and much of the book is extremely silly and objectionable. One-dimensional characters embracing Rand's philosophy spout pretentious drivel at each other while other types are introduced merely to sneer at them. The rape of the female hero leads to a passion for her rapist - appalling. Only some of the descriptions of cities or nature suggest a real writer mired in the dross. As philosophy, depends on your view point. As literature, unreadable.
