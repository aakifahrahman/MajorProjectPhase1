I too had to read this book for a scholarship. I'm saddened as to how other youths will probably buy into such a tragically flawed philosophy. Too many misunderstood young geniuses will compare themselves to Roark. They will repress emotions because they are believed to be Reasonable. They're lives will end the same as Rand's: Tragic, pathetic, and alone. Nathaniel Branden said of the Fountainhead: "Take the Fountainhead and the first chapter for example. Consider these facts: The hero has just been expelled from school, he is the victim of injustice, he is misunderstood by virtually everyone, and he himself tends to find other people puzzling and incomprehensible. He is alone; he has no friends. There is no one with whom he can share his inner life or values. So far, with the possible exception of being expelled from school, this could be a fairly accurate description of the state of the overwhelming majority of adolescents. There is one big difference: Howard Roark gives no indication of being bothered by any of it. He is serenely happy within himself. For average teenagers, this condition is agony." This is its youthful appeal. The objectivists’ philosophy is too simplistic and uncaring. The characters are noble and true to their emotions because society is against them, but in a society in which everyone become an objectivists these heroes will become the oppressors.
The protagonists (Dominique & Howard) are too ideological. The villains are straw men. The message is conveyed in a substandard way, it is far too preachy.
