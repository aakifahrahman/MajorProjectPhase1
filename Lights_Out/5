I don't know why anyone ever thought it was smart to connect our power grid to the internet. There's no reason it is necessary: after all, our power grid existed and functioned well long before the internet. I think we could probably still decouple the grid from the internet. I can see why some engineers and administrators might resist this, because it would make the power system less “high tech” and sophisticated. There are exciting things you can do when you’re connected to the internet that are not doable otherwise. It would mean returning the power system to the 80’s (or maybe even earlier) in some ways. But I think the risk from hackers far outweighs any advantage to an internet connection.

A friend who is a computer specialist gave these speculations about why the connection was made:

"I'm guessing the systems that run power plants are like any other system. They need to be upgraded with the latest software, capable of remote management in the event of disaster at the plant site, etc.

"Too inefficient for software engineers to send cds to power plants all over the country every time there's an update. If its a critical update, then you want that installed as quickly as possible."

But sometimes inefficiency is safety. Are we all going to have to face a disaster and store 3 months’ worth of food and supplies so our power plants can be more efficient? It doesn’t seem worth it.

I can see how in many instances, efficiency can be a priority. I work in a library, and maybe it can be a priority in our library systems, since there’s little chance North Korea or China would want to hack into them. Maybe even in industry, because if a factory’s systems are hacked, the losses can probably be remedied. It may hurt the factory’s profitability but not cost anyone’s lives. But when it comes to the safety of the country, things like our food and water supply, I don’t think efficiency should be the priority.
