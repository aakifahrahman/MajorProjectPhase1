I have always been a Ted Koppel fan so when I saw the chance to review his book I thought it was going to be a block buster. To the contrary, this book is slow, boring, and written in a top level way. It reads more like a mandatory text book as supposed to a *good* book the average person would want to read.

This book basically talks about: if we no longer had electricity/energy then it would throw our country into chaos. Our country is vulnerable to cyber attacks and terrorism that can shut down our electric grid and wreak havoc on our nation. So as you can see, the subject matter this books talks about is great. The issue with this book is purely the top level writing style (that reads like a textbook), and how slow and boring the information is presented.

If you are a patient reader then you might just love this book.
