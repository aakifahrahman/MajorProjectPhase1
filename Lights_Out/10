Good grief! I couldn't sleep at night after reading this book. This book is truly frightening as it is so very true that we are extremely vulnerable for a cyber attack. Ted Koppel weaves a very scary scenario if we are in the cross hairs of a cyber attack. Very well researched and written there is nothing not to believe in Lights Out.
This is a book that I feel everyone should read for an eye opening experience. I think Mr. Koppel should send a copy of Lights Out to every congressman and senator and the President and his cabinet and then maybe something will be done to prevent a catastrophe of huge magnitude in the USA.
