While I respect the seriousness of the issue, I can't help but wonder about the careful placement of a major question: What is the government doing about the problem. It's easy to get the attention of readers if you state the potential inadequacy of any government. We all (hopfully) know we can't look to governments to save us. A more apt question would be what are the power companies doing to protect the power grid. How are the power companies protecting their assets and income? As a news professional, the author knows what will draw attention and sell print, which is the chief end of the media in general. It's the responsibility of the power corrporations to provide power and to protect the means thereof and not the government. Let's not blame the government when the responsibility of public utilities lies with the companies that provide these services. If anything, the responsibility of the government should be to hold the power companies to a high standard of security considering the vast importance of the issue at hand. Just an observation I had probably with little significance.
