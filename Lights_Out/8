I do not need to be convinced that the grid is subject to cyber attack or that the industry or government is ill prepared to protect against such an attack. If you are in my camp, you will find this book to be very rambling and verbose. If you want to know all the ways that attacks could happen, how ill prepared we are, history of the Mormon Church, details of Mormon preparedness, examples dating to Biblical times, WW2 comparisons, etc. then this book is for you. The author will try his best to fill 280 pages.

I admit that I scanned most of the book, hoping to find useful information. On the plus side, the book does expose weaknesses in the Industry and Government to protect the grid. Maybe, thus exposed, they will act to improve. Not written to help me to be better prepared, except to point out that water and food for an extended outage is advisable.
