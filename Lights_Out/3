I hate to pick on Mr. Koppel who is, from all reports, a decent guy. But his book just repeats what large numbers of people have been saying for years. Anyone that has been paying attention already knows that and anyone that doesn't probably won't read the book anyway. Remember Leon Panetta and his "Cyber Pearl Harbor" speech? Today's Washington Post had an editorial on the subject (pg. A18). Nothing new is on offer here and the book also seems to be severely padded with not-very-helpful information like the extended description of the Mormons. Side note: a few years ago I was part of a federal disaster preparedness task force. Nobody wants to face the fact that there really is no way to prepare for a disaster on this kind of scale. If a cascading disaster like this happens on a national scale and you live East of the Mississippi you are probably screwed. If you live East of the Appalachians you are absolutely screwed. Tens of millions of hungry, thirsty, desperate people are going to come pouring out of the cities, ravaging the country and there is nothing that can be done about it.

The answer is a real live, hardened, serious national cyber security system and that doesn't seem to be happening on the necessary scale. Who's idea was it to wire everything to the internet anyway?
