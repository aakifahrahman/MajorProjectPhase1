As someone who works in the field of information security and who has done security assessments of power generation and transmission companies I had to read this book. It is a travesty and once again a click bait kind of story that our mass media has become today. For a fuller understanding of the real issues with this book I have written a blog post: https://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/lights-out-a-modern-tragicomedy/

Don't waste your money on this book if you want anything other than fiction.
