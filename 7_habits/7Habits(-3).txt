This book does not guarantee you success.  There are plenty of people who had gotten rich through random chance of events. As human being we rationalize it. For example, a gambler winning a large sum of money because he thinks we is smart but when he loses, he blames on luck, chance, the gambling institution etc. As a matter of fact much of the self-help industry is full of survivorship bias. This is unfortunate as people are sucked into this type of self-books because they don't have any self-discipline.
