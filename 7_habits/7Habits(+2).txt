The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is filled with so many great ideas. This book has a very strong reputation with over 25 million copies sold and it has been published in over 70 countries, the book has lived up to its name and reputation.

The information in the book is common sense, but as we learn, is not common practice. Before we learn about 7 habits, we must have healthy deposits in our "emotional bank accounts". Once we understand the idea of an emotional bank account, we begin to build the 7 habits. The goal of the book is to make this information a common practice and by the 7th habit, to sharpen our newly formed habits to ensure we enforce personal change.

If I had to choose one single take away from the book, it would be in habit #1 "Proactive people focus their efforts on their Circle of Influence." This idea is the beginning of learning how to separate the things that matter versus the things that don't and understanding that highly effective people operate based on their principles. Eliminating the circle of concern and investing in the circle of influence is what proactive people do.

I highly recommend this book, a must-read classic!
