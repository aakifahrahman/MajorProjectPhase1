This book is really overrated! I bought this book because of its so many positive reviews. But today I finished the 250 pages, just feeling that this book is not that good as the reviewers say. So I come back to see the negative reviews. Fortunately I found many have the similar impression on this book: 1. verbose; 2. many examples are just from the family of the author, and farfetched. 3. Over-analyzed.
