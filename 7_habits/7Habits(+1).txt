This book is a classic, timeless, relevant book about improving your life, no matter your age or status in life. It makes you think of things in a different way, and improves your overall outlook on life. I would have loved to have a father or grandfather like Steven Covey, as he seems so wise and family oriented. I would have loved to have met him.
