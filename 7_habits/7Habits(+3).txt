This book will change your life!! I am in my 20's and read this book in college. It brought insight and from new points of views that I never knew existed before. Depending on where you are in life (career, college, high school) you will likely see thing from a different point of view as it relates to you, but there is sure to be something here for everyone.

I heard about this book as a must read along with other very inspiring books like The Millionaire Mentor, Limited Edition, The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo, and Bob Proctor's books, and other phenomenal books on leadership and entrepreneurship. This book is another must have and I recommend it to anyone!
