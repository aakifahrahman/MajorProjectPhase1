I don't understand the reviews here. Aren't these reviews supposed to be the Audible or audio edition reviews? I was expecting most of the one star reviews to be about problems with the audio edition but nearly all of them seem to be based on the paperback format. How is this helpful to someone wanting a review of the audio edition? I also don't see how it's helpful for people to give such ridiculous reviews for the book. It's one thing to not like the book, but quite another to give such absurd reasons. People clearly indicating they have nothing but contempt for "self help" books but are supposedly continuing to read them and give them bad reviews. Really? Also, nearly all of the people who complain about self help books all of the time seems to give the same silly reasons. Yes, we know self help books have things in them that have been said before, and yes a lot of the things are common sense, and yes the book could be summarized into a much smaller book. (This last point is true for all books, but especially nonfiction.) What exactly are you expecting? I think most of these people are lazy and want some magic solution to their problems, or want something that has never been said by anyone since the beginning of time. Good luck with that.

I am NOT giving the book one star. The one star is for the audio edition. I don't know what the people producing the audio edition were thinking. Stephen Covey should NEVER read books to people! Unless you want to be put to sleep this version of the book is pretty much useless. Even more amazing is the fact that they haven't even recognized the problem and changed the narrator in a more recent audio edition.
