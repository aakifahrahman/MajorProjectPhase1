I had to buy/read this book for one of my business classes. It's an alright book, it isn't very entertaining. I feel like the seven habits are common knowledge. The book didn't really help me become a more effective person. The book is also very repetitive and does get boring very quickly.
Overall, if you have to read this book for a program or a class like I did, it's an alright book.
