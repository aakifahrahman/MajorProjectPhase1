This book and the ideas in it are life changing. You will find lots of cliché’s within this book not because it was written full of clichés but because of the cultural power of this book they became clichés. This is really a must read book for anyone from high school up, and should be reread every year or two. Exceptionally practical and helpful, this isn't a business book, this is a life book.

I have purchased at least ten copies of this book and have gone through the seminar with my entire company (over 130 people). Following the principles in this book will make you a more highly effective human.
