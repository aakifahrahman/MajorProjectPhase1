The details about training a goshawk were fascinating, especially since it was a female trainer. I liked the fact that Ms. Macdonald didn't try to turn her killer hawk into a lovable Disney character. Her descriptions of the bird were outstanding. The author wove the story of the training and some of the history of falconery into the recounting of her grief over her father's death. Then, she lost me. The many artsy literary chapters alternating with the hawking chapters were too much of a leap. I ended up skipping them and going forward to the next chapter. It seemed like too much padding of the plot.
