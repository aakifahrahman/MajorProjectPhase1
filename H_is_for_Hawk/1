I *really* wanted to love this book, but for me it truly missed the mark. Rather than feeling empathy for the author during what was surely a horrific time in her life, I felt ... well, bored. Despite the extremely personal subject matter, there is no vulnerability in the author's writing. And what this book lacks in emotional openness, it sadly makes up for in over-narrated sidebars that are both awkward and unrelatable. It was almost like each time the author came close to revealing herself (the very thing readers want more than anything), she lost courage and chose instead to reveal the inner turmoil of *another* author. And yes, I get it - the emotional parallels - blah blah blah. But it wasn't executed well and in the context of this book, makes the overall flavor extremely shallow.
