While the author writes well, I could not get past her self-centered view of life. She is imprisoning a hawk to give meaning to her empty life. She just fails to connect with people: she could not get past her own pain at the loss of her father to see her mother's even greater loss. Fails to be grateful and gracious to her friends. The contrast between the beautiful animal and the pathetic human was just too much to bear for me.
