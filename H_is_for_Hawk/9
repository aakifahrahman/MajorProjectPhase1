This book was *so* hyped, and some of the writing is lovely. (Some of it is also very annoying - just fragments, lots of repetition.)

So, a 30-something (?) woman allows herself to go weepily off the deep end when her father dies, and has the luxury of hiding out at Cambridge for months afterwards to indulge her misery and train a goshawk. She decides to write a memoir, but to get to book length, apparently has to pad it by summarizing and quoting from other books, primarily TH White's book about his goshawk. (Did she choose White because he was more of an emotional wreck than she, hoping for favorable comparison?) I kept thinking of the scene in "Moonstruck" and wishing Cher would leap into the plot to yell "snap out of it!!!"

Very disappointing.
