I may be one of the few people who didn't love this book. A more accurate rating for me would be 2.5 stars.

I was very excited to read this memoir by Helen Macdonald as I am a birder and was drawn to the idea that the author turned to raising a goshawk as a way to channel her grief over the sudden death of her father. The book starts off promisingly, and much of the language is lyrical and just beautiful to read. However, I found myself less and less interested while reading -- to the point where finishing the book seemed more like a chore than a pleasure.

Macdonald spends quite a large portion of the book analyzing the life an writings of author TH White, who wrote a book titled "The Goshawk." For me, I found the constant flashbacks to White to be a drag on the book. Frankly, I think I would have liked the book much better had she only focused on her experience instead making parallels to White's book.

For those interested in the subject matter, and the patience for a slow-moving book, I would recommend H is for Hawk. Others should probably skip it
