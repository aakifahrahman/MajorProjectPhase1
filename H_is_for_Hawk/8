Most of our book club members really liked it; I got no enlightenment out of it. It was everything one wanted to know about training a hawk, but I couldn't care less! The author (main character) was not particularly compelling, and I found her grieving over the death of her father excessive. I forced myself to read to the end, but except for a few dramatic moments, I was not happy doing so. Some members of our book club found the writing poetic.
