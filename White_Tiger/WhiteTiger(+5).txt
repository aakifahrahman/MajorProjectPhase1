This is a novel which presents so many conundrums about poverty, class structure, international relationships, family loyalties, betrayal, and guilt among other themes. The narrator's personality grows and changes and, in the end, even though he commits some egregious crimes, I learned to give him some grudging respect. He is very funny as he compares the problems of India to those of his correspondent's nation, China. You will not easily forget this book.
