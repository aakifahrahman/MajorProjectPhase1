What rubbish. I listen to this book on audio. The narrator mispronunced key words and names, but that is not what makes this novel so awful. The author's self loathing is very evident through the story. I have met many Indians who are uncomfortable with the inequalities in India. This discomfort turns into a cynical, "we rich get what we deserve" attitude. It is an attitude that unmines the richly descriptive writing. The author paints a richly detailed landscape. As an outsider, the picture of India's highly nuanced society is lost in ridiculous characters. It was wholly unsatisfying read. There are many other who capture India much better than this one.
