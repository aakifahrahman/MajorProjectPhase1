I suspect, in time, this will be regarded as a minor masterpiece. Novels with charismatic anti-heroes and a compellingly confronting social critique usually generate controversy. I wonder if the people who are appalled by this novel like 'Catcher in the Rye'?

In Balram, we have an urbane-yet-ignorant, honest-but-deceiftul, sympathetic-but-utterly contemptible character, worldly-yet-simplistic human being. There's something in his attitudes sure to delight and offend every shade of the ideological spectrum. His struggle to find a meaningful existence in a world where morality seems like an impediment is fascinating. There's a cliche: if you win the rat race, you're still a rat. This novel poses its readers a question: if the rat race is all you have, then shouldn't you be the biggest rat of all?

Two things: Balram repeatedly asserts there are only four great poets - all Muslim - and indeed they are fine choices. They're also the only poets he's ever heard of. And he can't even remember one of their names. And he thinks that Muslims, generally, are intellectually backwards. What a wonderfully contradictory character!

Read it, just so you know that you have.
