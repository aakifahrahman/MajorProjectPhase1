“The White Tiger” is written as a letter from Balram Halwai to the Chinese prime minister in which Balram offers himself as an example of an Indian entrepreneur. He tells of his impoverished childhood in a small village, a few years of schooling before his family sends him to work in a tea shop and how he eventually gets a job as the chauffeur for one of the married sons of the local wealthy family that controls everything in the village from the economy to the lives of the residents. The Americanized son and his wife are tasked with moving to Delhi and greasing any palms necessary to keep the family interests going. Balram quietly goes about his job—until the day he murders his boss—a fact he readily admits early on in the novel. He then uses his ex-boss’s money to start what becomes a very successful business.

Aravind Adiga does an exceptional, and often funny, job of weaving many of India’s problems into his tale: large scale poverty, rampant corruption, class inequality, inadequate education. He creates a poor but smart, hard-working protagonist you want to like and root for, but who is also a smug, amoral murderer. Balram seems so pleasant that I kept reading to find out what drove this seemingly docile man to murder. The implications of Balram as a symbol of lower class Indians (polite and eager to please while seething underneath), are plenty uncomfortable. Adiga never gets preachy or long-winded. Much like Mohsin Hamid’s 2014 novel, “How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia,” “The White Tiger” entertains and disturbs all at once.
