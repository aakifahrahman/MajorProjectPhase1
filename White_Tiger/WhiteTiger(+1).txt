Best contemporary novel I've read this year. Antidote for the pastel lyricism of most mainstream novels coming out of India and a wonderful social satire with savage bit. Kind of like Terry Southern's best work if he hadn't been all weeded up and goofy. 
An image from it that sticks with me is how Ghandi's image gets appropriated by the current Indian bureaucracy. Whenever the narrator encounters the hanging Ghandi portrait he sees it as a symbol of "bribes work here, corruption at work". Perhaps a statement that passive non-resistance is just what a huge corporate government wants to see in its citizenry.
Also poignantly captures the vast differences between the two Indias. The upper class world of Bangalore computer outsourcing money and the servant class that still lives in the middle ages.
