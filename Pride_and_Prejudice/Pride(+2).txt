Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a lovely book about manners, love, your station in life, and being proper. Told mostly from the viewpoint of the second Bennet daughter, Elizabeth, the story revolves around several groups of people all intertwined by family, friendship, or attraction. Nearly everyone is busy being proper or being horrified by those who are not and decisions are made based on assumptions about others. The vocabulary and word choices are wonderful. The story is a fascinating look into life in the Regency Era. The only problem I had with it is it’s hard to follow conversations sometimes since everyone sounds pretty much the same and who is speaking is rarely indicated.
