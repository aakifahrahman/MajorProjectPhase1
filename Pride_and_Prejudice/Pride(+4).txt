I have read Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice during my early years in college. I’ve always had a heart for classic novels, and perhaps it was the book’s popularity that lured me to it as well. Looking back on it seven years ago, perhaps I never really understood it as much as I wanted to. I knew how the story went, but maybe I never really knew what it meant. I forgot most parts of it and I have my poor long term memory to blame. So I read it again, thankfully most of the classics in amazon kindle store are budget-friendly.

On top of the things I fancied about the novel was first, the language. It sounded very formal, crisp, and even the insults sounded greatly pleasant to the ears. Elizabeth’s lines were witty and humorous and Darcy’s was, more often than not, short but sensible (as if he would only say something if necessary) and somewhat provocative.

Another thing I liked was the setting. It was so refreshing to see vast meadows and streams. It reminded me of the life at the countryside – simple, fun, and a wonder of its own. The bigger estates were fascinating as well. It certainly depicted the differences between the upper class and those below them. We could also see how often the characters talk about etiquette and manner, and perhaps during those times it was considered with utmost importance. It also showed us that their society is very much similar to ours in a lot of ways: problems with money and how important one’s salary is, girls and guys casually flirting with each other, love problems, people bragging about their connection, and stuff like that. Perhaps some things never really change.

Over-all, Pride and Prejudice seems like a modern fairytale where love prevails after overcoming hardships. It’s fun, sweet, and romantic. It’s truly a book that I would read over and over again.
