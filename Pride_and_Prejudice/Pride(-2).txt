Oh my gosh...I made another mistake.
A few years back I tried to read Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables. Why? because it was "literature", and I was visiting Salem and the House. Well...it took several hundred pages of dull, boring, sad, depressed writing before...well, nothing happened.
This time around I saw "Pride and Prejudice" on several "must read" lists. So, I tried.
Agh...convoluted prose, tedious topics, superficial women, truculent men, pages upon pages of ... nothing happening, except gossip about how rich the next guy is and whether it is ok to be from the country. But, it's "literature".
Geez...I will now slink back to my corner, totally shamed at my lack of culture and education. Woe is me.
