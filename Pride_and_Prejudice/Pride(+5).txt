How did I ever put off reading this book for so long?! In the past, I have watched many an adaptation of this beloved tale, so I already had a pretty solid idea of how events would transpire in the novel, but I was not disappointed by the original copy. I'm not going to lie, I had a difficult time getting through this book at times, as the language and sentence structure are challenging and archaic in many places throughout, as is to be expected. I did not mind it, however, as I was trying to find a version as close to unabridged as possible.
A couple things I didn't like about this book:
1) Many times, in reference to a specific place (I'm not sure if this was on the part of Ms. Austen, or the editors), as when Wickham's regiment was being described, a long ---- was put in place of their full name (I.e. "---shire" or "----street"). This got rather tiresome as the book went on, because if the name of it wasn't important enough to spell out entirely, why bother mentioning it at all?
2) I got rather peeved towards the last 25 or so pages, when entire groupings of words would end on one page, only to be repeated on the following page, and I would consequently lose my place and concentration. Get your ish together, guys
