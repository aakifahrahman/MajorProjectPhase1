Love this novel. I've read it dozens of times over the years and it's one of my all time favorites. There's always something happening so the average reader will never get bored. Literature aficionados will find something new in every reading. I recommend this and every Jane Austen novel. This is my backup e-copy for when I don't have access to my note-covered hard copy.
