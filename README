This repo contains the report, presentation, dataset, and code of the Final year Major Project done by AAKIFAH RAHMAN, ARUN JOHN KURUVILLA and THEERTHA GIREESAN, on SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON BOOK REVIEWS USING TEXT MINING.

Sentiment Analysis is the process of using text mining and natural language processing to identify and extract subjective information from text. Dictionary based classfication and machine learning based classification are the two methods implemented, with the former done by giving weights to individual words and the latter by training a model using training data and then using it to predict unseen data.

The challenges faced while implementing both methods include sarcasm detection, presence of abbreviations and incorrect spellings in reviews and poor punctuation and grammar. A primary lexicon based classfier using a dictionary was implemented which could classify reviews with an average accuracy of 65%. Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models were trained to predict review sentiments as part of machine learning based classification. These models had an accuracy of 89.38% and 86.11% respectively.
