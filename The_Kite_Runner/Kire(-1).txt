I really wanted to like this novel. judging from its thousands of 'five-star reviews' hailing it as the one of the 'best books ever written,' I’m in the minority when I state that this novel, while well-intentioned, just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth. 

my problems with the novel are as follows: first of all the writing itself is so ham-fastened, heavy-handed, distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point, i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall. Each page of the novel has at least 5-10 incomplete sentences. I’m all for experimental and fractured prose--but it's important for authors to use it judiciously. hosseini, unfortunately, beats it to death. a lot of his language is clichéd, too, which is funny considering there's a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator, amir, about using clichés.
