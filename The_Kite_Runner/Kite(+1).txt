What a powerful story. I didn't think I was going to like this book as much as I did... but I really did. I got so involved in this book that my emotions were going haywire. Not just feeling happy and sad as you do with most books, but feeling anxious and angry and disappointed. Everything these characters felt I began to feel. That's definitely the mark of a great novel and a great writer.
