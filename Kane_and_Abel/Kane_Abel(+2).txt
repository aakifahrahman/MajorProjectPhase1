Quite possibly Jeffrey Archer's most accomplished work. In "Kane & Abel" he employed the literary device of a looking at his protagonists and antagonists' lives through a wide-angle lens, a device he was again to employ to great effect in "As the Crow Flies" and, more recently, in "The Fourth Estate". Where many writers show us only a few years or even a few weeks in their characters' lives (and often that is quite enough), Archer is the master of fictionalizing entire lifetimes, and making them interesting enough that we are happy to be a part of them.
"Kane and Abel" tells the story of two men born on the same day yet in vastly differing circumstances. William Kane is born to wealthy New York parents at the dawn of what has been called The American Century, a life full of privilege and promise stretching before him. A world away, little Wladek Koskiewicz, bastard son of a Polish baron and one of the baron's peasants, has none of Kane's early advantages; no advantages at all in fact. Wladek's family is killed in the Great War and he sets sail for America with nothing more than the scantest of birthrights, a bracelet belonging to the dead Baron through the inscriptions of which the American Immigration official incorrectly documents him as Baron Abel Rosnovski.
Kane is stubborn, Abel determined; the two men cross paths repeatedly in business, each seeking to outmaneuver the other. Archer writes Abel as the more sympathetic character: his conscientious effort to become a better sexual partner and his later humiliation of Melanie Leroy, the daughter of his onetime business partner, are but two actions through which Archer shows us that Abel is endowed with the methodical focus and vindictiveness traditionally associated with those driven to rise above their current station in life. Kane has an early head start in the race and is portrayed more coldly. But both are men you'll never forget once you've read this book.
