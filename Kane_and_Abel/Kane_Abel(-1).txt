I struggled to finish this book. It bored me. There is little character development, and the writing style is dry. It reminded me of the way traditional fairy tales are told - a simple recital of: this happened, then that happened, then the next thing, etc. In spite of the dramatic events, the characters seemed to be lacking in passion. There is little said about their emotions, thought processes, personalities, etc., and as a result I didn't care about them.

Most of the book consists of complicated business wheeling and dealings, high-finance, and politics. Someone who has a special interest in these things would probably enjoy Kane and Abel very much. It just wasn't my thing.

I also guessed the surprise ending, even though it caused one of the plot threads to not make sense.
