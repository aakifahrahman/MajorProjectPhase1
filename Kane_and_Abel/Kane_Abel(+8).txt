This book caught my eye with its title--having a different spelling of Kane than the Biblical spelling. I read the back cover, and it looked interesting. Once I started reading, I was spellbound--I couldn't put it down. It's the story of two men--one born rich, the other poor, in two different countries, whose lives later become intertwined. This author is a master at transporting the reader into the human feelings of his characters. When I finished this book, I immediately ordered five more of Archer's books, just because he writes so well.
