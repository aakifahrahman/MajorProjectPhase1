In short, this is a story of two men from very different backgrounds whose paths cross on their ruthless struggles to fortune. Mr. Archer never lets you put this novel down. This is the best of the trilogy that Archer wrote and is an example for exemplary fiction by an impeccable writer. Once in a while you come across a book that makes you laugh, cry and hold your breath in suspense while providing an ecstasy of excitement.
William Lowell Kane is born to a powerful banking family in Boston while Abel Rosnovski is a polish immigrant to US after surviving the dangers of war. This novel follows in detail about the arduous tasks and tortures they face in their own way and how each one's path cross over. The master of prose explores in an intricately woven story, which is full of struggles, resilient brilliance of the two heroes and the power struggle of the two characters.
I think it is the best novels I have ever read. Most of the people tell me that 'Kane and Abel' is their favorite novel of all times. I was traveling while I was almost near the completion of the book and all the while I kept reading as I could just not put it down. A splendid book. Grab it and read it soon if you have not already. Deserves all the five stars and more in my opinion.
