This book was superb, I thought that it was displayed magnificently. A story about the lives of two completely opposite men, who come together and battle to the death. I thought that the author did a wonderful job in getting into detail about Abel's life and how he came to America. It really is a compelling story and I found that at times I just could not put the book down. I found that the book was intricately woven story that slowly began to unravel and the plot begins to thicken. Archer takes you through so many emotions as you read this book. Sometimes you want to laugh and others you fell like you want to cry. eg. When Florentina is killed and the brutality that they suffer. overall I thought that Kane and Abel was an amazing book and I would truly recommend The Prodigal Daughter, a continuation of Kane and Abel also by Jeffrey Archer.
