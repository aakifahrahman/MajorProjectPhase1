My 'hats off' to Jeffrey Archer! He's spun an ultimately very depressing tale of two extremely intelligent and talented men who wasted much of their lives, and especially their final years in foolish conflict that needlessly causes alienation between a son and daughter, etc, etc. The fact that I was depressed by the book is again a tribute to the author, who made me care even though a lot of the plot elements were hard to understand or hard to swallow. An example of 'hard to understand' was Kane's over the top reaction to his son's marriage. Up to that point I had been led to believe that it had only been Abel who had been dominated by hatred toward the other. Kane was worried about Abel but had often shown begrudging admiration for him, never mindless hatred. And why, when the son and daughter were telling their respective parents of their upcoming marriage, did neither explain the unusual circumstances of falling in love prior to learning of the relationship between their fathers, rather than leaving their fathers to think that there was some sort of knowing betrayal in them having come together? And, speaking of hard to swallow, the two main characters, both filled with patriotic duty, independently join the military and the one who is in charge of food services finds himself on the same battlefield as the man he hates and rescues him from among hundreds of casualties and neither ever know who the other was!!! Or, their son and daughter randomly meet in Bloomingdales and fall in love.
