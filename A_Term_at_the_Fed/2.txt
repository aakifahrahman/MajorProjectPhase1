Years ago, I was intrigued with the idea of "The New Economy" and wanted to educate myself on the topic. I began with Woodward's Maestro, then picked up some textbooks on Macroeconomics, all the while keeping up with the business news. Dr. Laurence Meyer, known as a "hawk," popped up in the news frequently, and caused many Wall Street types to tremble ...which I found very amusing. I also enjoyed his sense of humor, transparency and trustworthy (if not always welcome) insights which turned up in the news as well. This set me up to grab his book when it came out.
When "The New Economy" fell apart, I, like everyone else, wondered what happened and where we would go from the wreckage. I've been waiting for this book. Humorous asides that allow one to vicariously enjoy Meyer's trip into "DC land" while studying an account of the economic history taking place during his term, make the book hard to put down. The likable Meyer reveals an endearing humility and strength of character in drawing himself not only as person who is proud of his accomplishments, but one secure enough to share his foibles and fears for the amusement of the reader. Most importantly, Meyer's experience as a professor shines as he magically makes complex economics concepts easier to understand for non experts such as myself.
If you want another tome about Greenspan, this one is not going to tell you anything earthshaking or new. But if you are interested in a educational report written by an extremely knowledgeable, intelligent, forthright, and witty man, on the workings of the Fed during an intriguing time in US economics , Meyer's book is for you.
