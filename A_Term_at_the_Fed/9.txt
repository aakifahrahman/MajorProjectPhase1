Meyer's book succeeds in providing an excellent view of how the Federal Reserve governors make monetary policy, the personal, organizational and economic aspects. Yet in some ways this is a disappointing effort. In particular, the middle of the book is kind of dull, almost repetitious. Once Meyer's term approaches the turbulent economic times which culminate in the bursting of the equities bubble, the book becomes interesting again. Meyer has a gift for explaining economics, and he has a wonderful personality, the type of person you would like to have as a friend: he clearly enjoys life, is warm, positive about other people, modest, truthful, objective. Perhaps the problem is that it just isn't very interesting being a Fed governor. Or it may be that the book is too focused. For example, the productivity acceleration that Greenspan was sure was taking place took a long time to be reflected in the economic statistics, but once it was, it was also determined that the historical statistics had been significantly wrong! Meyer had nothing to say about these errors, other than to note them. Meyer also had much too little to say, to my mind, about why the Federal Reserve did not adjust margin requirements when it thought there was probably an equity bubble. Read this book, but do not hesitate to skip some of the chapters.
