Warning: the positive reviews here are almost certainly written by economists who have intimate understanding of the material. Either there was no editor or the editor didn't care, but Meyer rambles on aimlessly and then makes concrete statements that suggest that his mind was thinking things he neglected to explain or commit to print. While there may be valuable history here, he should not have attempted to have written it himself without the aid of a ghost writer or editor.
