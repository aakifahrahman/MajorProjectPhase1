If you are looking for a tell-all confessional about the wild coke-filled parties that take place before meetings of the FOMC, this book will be sorely disappointing to you. But if you want to be reassured about the level of economic discourse at the meetings of the FOMC, you will also be disappointed. More than one academic economist has commented on the low level of economic discourse in Washington (see, for example, 'Peddling Prosperity' by Paul Krugman or 'The Roaring Nineties' by Joe Stiglitz). This book will do little to disabuse readers of the notion that most economic policy is made with a good deal of intuitive guesswork (e.g., about where the NAIRU is in this case) and great uncertainty about even the current economic situation (e.g., the lack of evidence on productivity growth until years after the Fed was being forced to make decisions). While hardly reassuring, this probably gives a pretty good idea of how most policy is made! The book has some interesting parts (e.g., the power of Mr Greenspan, the importance of consensus, the lack of internal discussion outside of the meetings, and the great uncertainty about even short-term policy making). But it is very slow--no revelations about the personalities involved (including Mr Greenspan) or the internal politics of the Fed. Moreover, if you have been reading the popular press over the past decade (e.g., The Economist or Business Week), most of the economic discussion (e.g., over productivity growth) will be old news. So should you buy it? If you want a primer on how the Fed works, this is probably a good place to start. Just drink lots of coffee before attempting to read it!
