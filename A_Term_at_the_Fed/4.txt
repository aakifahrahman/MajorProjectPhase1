This is an outstanding book. My one star rating was due to the fact that it arrived damaged. I was well aware that it would have a mark on the pages - and on the bottom, there's a black mark, like from a magic marker. I've got no problem with that. But on the front cover, it appears that whomever handled it had greasy hands. So it's smudged. Second book that I've ordered from them that has arrived damaged. Can people not wash their hands before they pack orders???????????? UPDATE: Okay, so I called Amazon and they sent me a new book via overnight UPS, and unlike the first one, this one was not damaged. While I'm happy about that, it appears I'm going to have to spend a dollar to go buy a envelope to mail it back because the replacement didn't arrive in a box. I don't like that. I have, however, finished reading the book and there's probably a few things worth saying about it. Overall, I liked the book. It's extremely well written. I think I saw a review that talked about needing to be an economist to understand it. I don't know that I believe that. Would it hurt? No. You're going to see a lot of economic terminology (surprise), particularly NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) and quite a bit of discussion on productivity and its impact on inflation. If you are able to think critically, one's lack of an economic background will not be an impediment. This book was written while Greenspan was Chairman, so there's quite a bit of talk about inflation in the context of the Fed's dual mandate. As the author says, it's not a dishy, expose of the Fed either. It is not a negative, bash the Fed type book, so if you're looking for something along those lines, buy Rand Paul's book. I thought it was a fantastic book. I have no regrets about buying it and I felt like it gave a behind-the-scenes look at how the Fed tried to make monetary policy during the late 90's and early 2000's.
