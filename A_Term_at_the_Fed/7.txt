I have just finished reading A Term at the Fed: An Insider's View by Laurence A. Meyer, first published in 2004. There is not much to say about this book that other reviewers have not already said. I found it to be enjoyable and educational, though perhaps a little dry at times. Meyer is not a titan like Alan Greenspan, but more of a regular guy. He was a professor for almost 30 years in St. Louis before working as a Fed governor, and gives the point of view of a Washington outsider. I did not know much about the Federal Reserve Board before reading this book, and now I feel that I have a better grasp on the operations there in deciding monetary policy. The Fed is truly powerful, and the governors have a heavy burden of responsibility and stewardship. The Chairman steers the course and is probably more important that all other members of the committee combined. However the Chairman could not exist without the committee. I do not believe markets would react well to one man alone setting monetary policy. Meyer also details his constant struggle to be correctly interpreted by the media. As a relative newcomer to Washington and being covered by the press, he believes actually might at sometime be portrayed accurately. More experienced people recognize this as futile. For a Fed governor, it is probably better to just remain silent. It's a hard load to bear, and after six years, Meyer is only too happy to leave the Fed. I half-heartedly recommend this book.
