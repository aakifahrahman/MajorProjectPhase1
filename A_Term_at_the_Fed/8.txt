"A Term at The Fed" by Laurence H. Meyer is a very educational and thought provoking book regarding the decision making processes at the Fed. Meyer readily admits that his thoughts did not always agree with thoughts of the other Fed Governors. The book also gives some detail regarding the Fed staff support information to which Fed Governors have access. One sobering realization is that the Federal Reserve Governors and staff DO NOT KNOW THE CORRECT ANSWER BEF0RE MAKING A DECISION!! However they probably make the best decisions possible based on the available information at the time of the decisions. This book would be of value to persons managing a business and to individuals self-managing personal assets and personal pensions, as well as to commercial and investment bankers. Some talking-heads in the media might be enlightened also.
