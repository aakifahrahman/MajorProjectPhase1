I got this book on Audiobook. I LOVE hearing Leah read in her NY accent. Scientology is going to be so pissed when they read this book (according to her they won't read it - but still). This book DELIVERS! With her brash, down to earth and honest style, Leah spills allllll the tea and I'm totally loving it!
