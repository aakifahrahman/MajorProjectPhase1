I'm interested in the Scientology story much the way I'm interested in the mafia and the nazis, in a dark macabre way. Unfortunately this book did not reveal very much about the inner workings of Scientology and not much was new to anyone that has read about the subject or seen Going Clear for that matter. I think the biggest problem with this book is the fact that Leah Remini just isn't very sympathetic. Throughout the book she offers examples of her incredibly poor judgment and stupid decisions and even though I realize she's from Brooklyn and promotes the idea that she speaks her mind I found the writing to be harsh and the vulgar language got old pretty quickly. If you're looking for a good book about Scientology that will even keep you on the edge of your seat read Blown by Marc Headly.
