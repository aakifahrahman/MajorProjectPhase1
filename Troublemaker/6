I am always eager to read anything that shows just how terrible Scientology really is, so I downloaded this book feeling confident that it would more than fulfill that expectation -- which it certainly did. However, I knew nothing about Leah Remini, having never seen her shows or paid any attention to her as a person. The woman I encountered by reading this was coarse and foul-mouthed to a degree that I found her to be utterly unlikeable. Um, we've all heard the f-word before, and throwing it all over the place throughout this book is immature, low-class, and mind-numbingly boring. For its effective and detailed blasting of a disgusting and dangerous cult, I'm glad I read it.
