Never been a celeb, never been a Scientologist, never lived in Brooklyn, but God....it's like we're the same person;) I seriously kept thinking this while reading because Leah is just so relatable. And the themes and internal struggles and external hurdles are universal. Plus, it's funny, juicy, and totally freaky. Bravely written. Bravely lived. Loved it.
