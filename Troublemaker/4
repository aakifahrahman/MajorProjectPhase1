Not as informative as I thought it would be. Some of the same stories about scientology that have been told before. Interesting tidbits about some of her famous friends but in the end I found that she does seem to be a bit arrogant and rude. She needs to understand that her family may think she is funny but in reality she comes across as not too funny but rude and unprofessional at times.
