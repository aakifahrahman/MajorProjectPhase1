I guess I am one of those people who just don't get it. Her "popularity"... I don't get it. Her "acting skills"... I don't get it. Her whining about being brave after being kicked out of the scientology club... I don't get it. She has always been a big mouth, always rude on tv- interrupting others, talking over others because they don't agree with her warped sense of how she's lived her life. Usually, people like her wait until their "career" is in the toilet before they write a book about life in the toilet bowl of success. I guess she just simply wanted to hurry and tell her side before scientology told theirs. I couldn't get past the third page. I'd suggest another book to read- Minnie Pearl's autobiography is one of the best autobiographies you'll ever read (Minnie Pearl: An Autobiography). Why? Because it's about the struggles of life and fame without the bitterness and blame.
