It's hard to believe that people get caught up in this cult, especially those that are not brought in as children. Even though Leah was brought in as a child, she endured so much horrible s***, especially after the wedding of Katie and Tom, that it is easy to wonder about her intelligence. Also wonder about Katie Holmes and why it took her 6 years to get out.

The book is very well written and Leah only has an 8th grade education. Did she write it??
