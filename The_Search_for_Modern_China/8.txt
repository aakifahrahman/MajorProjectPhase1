I'm learning Chinese and have a shelf full of books about China which I've recently been plowing through. One of the book I read was "The Death of Woman Wang," by Jonathan D. Spence, the author of "The Search for Modern China." I checked the book out of the library, and was so impressed by it that I decided to buy it and absorb it at my own speed, not the reading speed imposed by the library due date. This is a richly researched book. Since China is one of the world's oldest civilizations, the search for modern begins in the 1600's. This is not an easy read, but it's worth the effort if you're interested in China.
