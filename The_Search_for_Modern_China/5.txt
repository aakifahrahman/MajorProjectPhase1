Jonathan Spence concludes that following the Tian An Men Square crack down in 1989, China's quest for modernization remained unfulfilled. As much as I like and respect Spence's work, this strikes me as more of a moral judgement than an objective historical analysis.
I would have enjoyed this book more (and given it a much higher rating) if Spence had distanced himself from his Western preconceptions of what constitutes a modern nation, and instead focussed on the Chinese definition of successful modernization. What elements do the Chinese feel constitute modern China? How much of the West do they feel China must emulate? Which of its traditions can China keep and to what extent? How does the concept of modernization differ between China and the West?
Despite its many wonderful qualities, this book has one fatal intellectual flaw: it is more concerned with one Western historian's search for modern China than it is with China's search for modern China. In this respect it is more of a romantic and colorful essay of vast proportions, than an objective scholarly analysis.
