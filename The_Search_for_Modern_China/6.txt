For the sake of brevity, I should point out in one stroke that this "history on China" is one of the shallowest work on the subject I have ever read. Even if only taking the small sample of books on China here at Amazon.com, one would discover that most works are superior in knowledge and analysis.
This book further confirms my earlier suspicions of Spence's fitness to be considered a reputable historian on China. His writings are no better than his lectures at Yale, as they all suffer from the same chronic syndrome of his personal prejudices at the expense of decent history writing. I find no choice but to admit that Spence is a self-styled "authority" more than anything else.
I notice that certain reviewers on this site give acclaims to Spence solely because his book is easy to read and follow according to them. Maybe that should be a hint, not to the high quality of the book, but to some people's willingness to accept the most naive and simple views on history.
