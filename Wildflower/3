This book feels like you are literally picking up Drew Barrymore's journal and flipping through the pages. It's scattered, goes all over the place, but has a peaceful feel in its entirety. Some entries are about the mundane. There is a section on trimming plants. Some sections read like poetry; other sections are jarred by random swearing. It's quite eclectic. To describe it best, the book gives off a sense of personal affirmations. Barrymore's reading of the audio book is a big plus.
