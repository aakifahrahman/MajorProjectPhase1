Do not expect a well thought out memoir which a timeline that makes sense. Its basically a compilation of stories , all missed at different times, there is not a reason as to why she goes from one story to another. She also stop in the middle of stories to describe people for pages upon pages (she usually uses these times to thank and praise them) but then, diverted by the description and praise of the characters, she does not finish the story. You do find yourself wondering why you are being taken back and forward in time and what exactly are you reading at times. No ghost writer in this book for sure, most chapters read like a movie script. She would have benefited from some guidance and direction when it comes to creating a timeline for her book.
