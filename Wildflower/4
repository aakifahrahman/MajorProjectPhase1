Let me preface this by saying I love Drew with all my heart. She's one of kind. That being said, her book is pretty dull. After reading Drew's book, I will now promise to steer clear of books by celebrities that are not "memoirs" but rather "stories" (ie Goldie Hawn, Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine). The book is poorly organized in a chronological sense and many of the stories are incredibly self-involved.

Many celebrities these days write "collections of stories" ala Chelsea Handler, however lacking the sophisticated eye and the comedic timing. I think many celebrities forget how different they are from civilians and believe that them sharing their life is in and of itself enlightening. Her story about taking her late dogs ashes to India and trying to make pancakes were pretty cloying.

There are moments of brilliance and depth, but they are few and far between. In an attempt to keep her book "positive" it becomes pretty arduous. Also, after her wild child days it was disheartening to hear she has strong opinions about what is appropriate now and for her own daughters. She seems a little repressive and obsessed with having a perfect family. Not surprising, considering her upbringing.

The book starts out strong and them falls off track. Not highly recommeded
