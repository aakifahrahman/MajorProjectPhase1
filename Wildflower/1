I am a huge fan of Drew...she just seems like an honest, down to earth person who made the best of her tumultuous past.I really wanted to love this book, but the style of writing and the disjointed tales made it hard to follow. This book is not a biography or memoir. .it is a collection of memories in story form.Found myself losing interest about 1/3 of the way into each chapter. ..I think I enjoyed her radio and tv promos for the book, more than the book.
