I am a fan of Drew Barrymore's movies, and being of the same generation, I root for her. Sadly, I did not love this book, and I so wanted to. She is clear upfront that it is not a memoir, but I feel it should have been. The book lacked structure. As opposed to a memoir like Tina Fey's, Amy Poehler, Michael J Fox, Dick Van Dyke, etc., this book did not follow chronologically through her life; rather, it hopped randomly from topic to topic and through different time periods of her life. I felt like, had there been a clearer thread that tied the essays to each other, it would have been a more enjoyable read. Also, I felt that many of the essays were in a weird "middle place"-- not quite comedic, but not quite introspective either. It was almost like she didn't want to fully commit to a style, or was afraid to really let the reader in. I will remain a fan of her movies and production work, but felt she lacked direction as an author.
