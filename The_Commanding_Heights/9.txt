This was a fascinating book, but I wanted it more balanced. I wanted to better understand Marriner Eccles role in bringing supply side economics to solve the great depression and fund WWII. I understand the "Rut" Keynesian economics found itself in in the '70's but I wanted to understand that Hayak and Friedman actually went beyond Keynes. Sadly, I didn't find it here. Yes, great historical and analytical writing on a great many world economies, but not the justification for globalization it claims. We return to Laissez-Faire, Global economics and Surprise Surprise Surprise, the world is once again thrown into wild swings of booms and busts, widening income disparity, environmental degradation and economic insecurity for the vast vast majority. No Improvement. I'm now convinced of the opposite of the thesis of this book. I'd prefer 5% inflation (just ask a Realtor) and the middle class life my parents and grandparents enjoyed in the 50's 60's and 70's to the current situation. Long Live Keynes!
