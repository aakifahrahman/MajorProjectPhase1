This is a curious work marred by the surprising lack of intellectual and historical perspective displayed by the authors. Written on the eve of the dot-com bust, and a decade before the economic meltdown of 2008, Yergin and Stanislaw used this book as a platform to ballyhoo the (in their view) ultimate and final triumph of deregulated laissez-faire economics over the Keynesian mixed-economic policies which led to the unprecedented and widely-distributed prosperity which defined the post-WWII era in the industrialized "First World" and America in particular. The two may have just been opportunistically playing to the hordes of penny-ante speculators who were busy emptying their savings accounts to invest in the electric fork in the late 1990's, or they may be truly indifferent to what deregulation has wrought--the de-industrialization of America, the dissolution of the American middle-class, and the extreme economic stratification that the country now faces. Whatever their motives, they present here a highly unbalanced and selective overview of economic developments in the second half of the 20th century, and readers should take their pronouncements with a grain (maybe a sack) of salt. It's interesting to note that Yergin again demonstrated his highly selective interpretation of facts in his account of the Bush administration's 2003 run-up to the invasion of Iraq and the whole "weapons of mass destruction" farce in his later book "The Quest". Yergin's been running on fumes since the publication of "The Prize" a quarter of a century ago, but this book might be his worst due to the seriousness of the subject and his complete lack of objectivity in exploring it.
