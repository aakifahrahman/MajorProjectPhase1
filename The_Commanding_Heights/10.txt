I was curious to see what the reviewers might be saying about the declarations, which "The Commanding Heights" serves-up as resolute truth, relative that is to the very near collapse of the world market economy in 2008. Seems these ardent free-marketers have shrunk back; their fingers-on-the-pulse a little iffy, ever since the over-night insolvency and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. While an informative read, with every turn of the page, and no matter the sensibilities outlined, always remained in the back of my mind about his book: "sounds perfectly sensible and credible until things suddenly go starkly wrong!"
