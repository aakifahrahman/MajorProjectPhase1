I don't know if it's a literary trend or not but I have four books in the last year that were written in this disjointed, flipping back and forth between characters style. This one was lacking for me and confusing. I had to stop and go back on a couple of occasions to figure out who someone was that had been quickly introduced earlier. I'm really not sure why some of the characters were brought into the story. I wanted to like the book because Mazie seemed like such an
Interesting character.
