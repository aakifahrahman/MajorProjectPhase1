Maize is certainly a very interesting woman with a dysfunctional family and a heart of gold. But the style of the book with disjointed diary entries paired with the commentary of others made me feel disconnected from her and her story. The section on helping the homeless men goes on too long and is too repetitive and then the story suddenly ends without much resolution about her life. That was disappointing. However the tenements and the streets felt very real.
