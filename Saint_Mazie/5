I am left bereft that a book that glorifies the capture and torture of wild predators should be so lauded as to become a best seller. I had no idea and I was unprepared for the hollowness of the premise for this book. A woman suffers the personal loss of the death of a parent and decides that an appropriate response is to purchase, essentially cage, and then mold a raptor to meet her emotional needs. What can a feeling human being say about that?
