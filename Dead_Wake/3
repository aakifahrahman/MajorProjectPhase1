Not the best of his books. I have read them all and this one just did not stick out like the others. Maybe it was because the story is already so well known. I enjoyed his other books more because they were about a moment in history that has not been covered well by other authors. This one just had nothing really unique to offer. None of the passenger stories were very compelling. It's not a bad book just not up to Larson's usual deep storytelling.
