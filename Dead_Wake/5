I always look forward to anything by Erik Larson...I even pre ordered this book. It was just OK. The actual novel was short with over a third of the book consumed by the references that Mr. Larson includes, some of which are interesting but most tedious. I don't know if the current kindle price of $2.99 reflects it's sales, but I was disappointed by paying the 12.99 pre order price.
