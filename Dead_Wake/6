I love Erik Larson, and his last book (Midnight in the Garden of the Beasts) was fantastic. I wanted to love Dead Wake, but I didn't. It was badly in need of an editor, and while Mr. Larson did his usual deep dive of all the sources, the end result was just not satisfying. The stories of the different passengers were occasionally interesting and occasionally not especially interesting; the details about the President and his "issues" were over-done, and the backing-and-forthing between the different "scenes" - the boat, the submarine, the secret code room, the White House - were choppy and uneven. That being said, Mr. Larson did manage to build some tension at the actual point of impact, and I kept reading to the end. I came away not especially convinced that the sinking of the Lusitania had much to do with the war, that the "big deal" about the alleged munitions on the boat was not a big deal, and that the whole event, including some interesting anecdotes about some interesting passengers - and some ordinary folks on the boat - could have been recounted in an article in History Today. For research, I give the book 5 stars; for narrative I give it 2 stars; and overall I rate it below Mr Larson's best efforts.
