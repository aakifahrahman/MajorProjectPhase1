Not my favorite Larson book, but still very interesting and sad (as you'd expect when you know the story ends with a thousand people dying). I didn't know any of the details about the sinking of the Lusitania until I read this. I found the details about the WWI British intelligence efforts and the operations of the U-boats to be interesting. However, Larson put in too much extraneous information for me. I could have done without all the details about President Wilson - his wife's death, the woman he ended up meeting after her etc. The same goes for all the detail about Churchill. I felt that was all unnecessary and a bit too much. He also went into a ton of detail about a couple of the passengers that I thought got to be boring and too much - in particular all the detail about the guy that dealt in rare books. Overall, still worth the read just to learn more about a moment in history that I didn't know much about.
