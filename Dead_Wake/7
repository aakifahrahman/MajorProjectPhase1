The story of the Lusitania is so inherently compelling that any writer as skillful as Larson will write something worth reading.That being said the book as a whole was disappointing to me.The whole effort had the feel of rush job put together to cash in on the revived interest surrounding the 100th anniversary.
Every author has to pick and choose what to focus on but why the digressions onto Woodrow Wilson's love life and not even the barest mention of the selfless and heroic conduct of the Vanderbilt heir Alfred? This is really strange,either a deliberate omission for some reason or an inexplicable
oversight.
I also feel like I've been chisiled because I shelled out $28 bucks for this book and there is not one single photograph! I ordered online so I didn't realize till I got the book in hand that this was the case or I would not have made the purchase.The 2002 book written by Diana Preston has many dramatic,interesting and sometimes haunting photos (check out the American nurse looking out over the railing on page 116) .Though maybe not written with quite as much style as Larson's it contains a lot more insight and information about the passengers and is a much more honest effort.
