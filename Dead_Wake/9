Having read several other Larson titles, I was expecting a fast-paced, gripping narrative of rivaling historical perspectives. However, Dead Wake, much like the Lusitania, did not move at full speed. Often, I found myself swimming in debris of mundane details that did not provide richness nor intrigue. It was only by forcing myself to paddle past the first half of the book that the story line finally picked up. In the same way that travel by boat is a laborious expenditure in relation to more efficient modes of transportation, so too are the prose of Dead Wake. The latter half of the book does redeem the book. However, I wouldn't choose to read it again, unless I was embarking on a minutiae-ridden journey, like a transatlantic voyage.
