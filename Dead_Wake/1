This is the first Erik Larson book I've read and I'd heard his histories read like novels. However, I wasn't that blown away by it. So much of the details seemed like needless filler, and there was a strange choice to have the parallel narrative of Woodrow Wilson fixated on his love life. It dragged down the overall story to keep getting sidelined back to his daily rounds of golf and pining letters to Edith Galt, playing the sad sack swain, while all the other narratives were actually involved in some way with the Lusitania's voyage. Maybe the choice was to contrast Wilson's detachment as a metaphor with American neutrality to Europe's deep and desperate engagement in the war? I don't know....whatever the intention, it didn't work for me.

As with James Cameron's Titanic, the pace didn't really pick up until the boat started to sink. And even then, I recall far more exciting times - as well as an overall pleasanter experience - reading David Butler's soapy potboiler "Lusitania." Some of the details from Larson's book are in Butler's, with the added spice of dramatic license. "Dead Wake" was entertaining enough, but I doubt I'll remember it all that fondly in the future. It's just a standard popular history, fluffed and bloated somewhat to justify page count.
