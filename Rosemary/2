I read a lot of excellent history books, and I have to say that this wasn't one of them. I'm sure it was difficult to get information on this hidden and handicapped Kennedy daughter, but, then, why write a book if you can't get that information? The basic story is known already by anyone who has read much about the Kennedy family. What I had hoped to learn was what Rosemary's life was really like for decades. We get snippets of information but nothing very substantial from firsthand sources who were there in the places where Rosemary lived for so long -- or even secondhand sources who knew people who were there. Given that Rosemary died in this century, I would think that there would be more living people to interview for such a book. The letters from Rosemary are interesting, but not enough. I guess what troubled me most, again as a reader of history, was the frequency of the author's stated assumptions, which I found surprising. What "might have happened," what someone "might have thought," etc. don't really belong in a well-researched history book. One has a feeling that the author (from the east coast?) went to the Kennedy library and never even travelled to the Midwest facility where Rosemary spent so much of her time. If I missed something, please correct me.
