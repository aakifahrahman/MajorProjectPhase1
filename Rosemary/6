There wasn't much to this book, at least in part because Rosemary Kennedy was mentally handicapped, then lobotomized by her father when she was 23. The author spent half the book describing the many institutions and schools Rosemary attended without much success and rest inferring many of the other Kennedy siblings' accomplishments helping the handicapped were inspired by Rosemary's disability and fate. It's a small shard of history that illuminates the difficulties faced by the handicapped in the early 20th century, and so not unimportant. But not exactly fascinating, either.
