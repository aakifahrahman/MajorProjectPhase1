 have always enjoyed reading about the Kennedy's and the British royalty. Two of my favorite subjects. There has been very little written about Rosemary. As the title indicates "The hidden Kennedy daughter."
For many of my 66 years I didn't even know that she had existed.
I strongly recommend this book if you too enjoy reading about the family.
There are little known facts here and a very interesting book.
Enjoy...
