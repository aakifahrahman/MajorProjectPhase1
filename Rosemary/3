I was a little disappointed that the book covered more of Roses ' life than that of Rosemary 's. But, I suppose one had to understand Rose first (And Joe ) in order to understand how Rosemary ended up where she spent 60 years of her life. I really wanted to know more about Rosemary 's life whIle at Saint Colleta's.
