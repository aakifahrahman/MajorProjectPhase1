A good account of a terrible tragedy. Joe and Rose Kennedy were very bad parents. I never liked Joe and he made a very bad decision for Rosemary. However, I finished the book thinking he knew he made a bad decision, lived with it for the rest of his life and really tried show his love for Rosemary. Not so for Rose. She didn't make the bad decision that Joe made but she didn't provide the comfort for Rosemary that a mother should.
