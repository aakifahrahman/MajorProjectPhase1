It's abundantly clear that Rosemary Kennedy didn't suffer any so called 'intellectual disabilities'. Look at her photos! This is one very bright, vibrant and charming young woman. At best, she may have been dyslexic. May have been.

In all likelihood, the reason her parents (yes, not only her father but her 'sainted' mother) had her lobotomized was because she was acting out sexually, in the typical Kennedy style. Only what was okay for the Kennedy boys, wasn't okay for this girl. The other girls preferred playing football to men, so they were spared lobotomies.

Awful, awful family.
