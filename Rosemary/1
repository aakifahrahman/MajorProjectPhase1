I just don't understand how people think this book was well-researched. Larson seems to largely quote from the letters and/or diaries of Rose Kennedy -- documents that were donated to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and are available to the public. What about interviews with people who knew Rosemary? She only died 10 years ago. There were no caretakers who could give in-depth information about her last years and her interactions with her family? Instead, it seems like Larson just lists previously reported information or, worse, "assumes" scenarios. For example, since she could find no record of Rosemary's lobotomy and didn't speak with anyone with actual knowledge of it, she merely writes about what must have happened to her, describing the surgery step-by-step the way it was performed on EVERY lobotomy patient. All too often, Larson uses phrases like, "Rosemary must have felt..." or "Surely, Rosemary was..." because she has no actual INFORMATION about anything.

Sure, the book is interesting -- because the subject and her very shocking story is interesting. But is it a well-researched tome? Absolutely not.
