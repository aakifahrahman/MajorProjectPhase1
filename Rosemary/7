After reading the article in People magazine about this book, I was captivated and looked forward to its release. I've always had an interest in the Kennedy family and this was one more opportunity to learn more about them. Though there were parts that were interesting, I found much of it tedious. Most surprisingly, my opinion of matriarch, Rose, changed considerably, in a negative way. And I was very perplexed to get to the end of the story and have my Kindle say I had completed just 63%. Acknowledgments, notes and the index took up the remaining 37%. It left me feeling cheated.
