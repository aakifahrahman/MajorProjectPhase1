Beryl Markham's glorious autobiography, "West With the Night," was so amazingly well-written that Ernest Hemmingway declared: "the b--ch writes circles around me." The biography titled "Straight on till Morning" offers even more details of Markham's adventurous life. So why read a fictionalization of a truly larger-than-life individual? Especially a fictionalization that turns Markham's life into an insipid romance novel? Please, people! Read her true story and skip this mess.
