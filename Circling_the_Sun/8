Let me start by saying that Paula McLain is a very good write from the point of view of style. But I found the book disappointing--actually misleading. From the title and Markham's fame you would think that the focus would be on her flying. Not so. Her flying, probably the best part of her life, was almost totally marginalized in favor of Markham's personal life, the least happy part of her life. Further, the second half of her life was omitted entirely. I guess you can do anything you want with historical fiction, but in this case I did not like the choices that were made. Readers be warned as to what to expect.
