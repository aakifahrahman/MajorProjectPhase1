I never read 'The Paris Wife' so I have nothing to compare this to, but as a first time reader of her work, I thought it was fine. The story is a fictionalized retelling of the life of Beryl Markham, a strong, fierce independent woman who grows up in Africa, becomes a brilliant horse trainer, and was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from the East to the West. She was also involved with Denys Finch Hatton, the free spirited man who was the lover of Karen Blixen, aka Isak Denesen of 'Out of Africa' fame. I actually struggled with the beginning of the book until Beryl comes into contact with Hatton, which isn't till nearly halfway through the story. Then the narrative perked up for a me a bit, but I never personally really connected. Perhaps because so much ground was being covered, perhaps I'm just not the intended audience.
