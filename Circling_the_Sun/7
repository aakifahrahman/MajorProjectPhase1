I started this book prepared to like it. I had read the author's previous book, The Paris Wife, and liked it very much. When I got done, I felt irritated, and am still struggling with why this book bothered me so. It's well written, though occasionally repetitive about the characters, especial about Denys Finch Hatton, best known as the love interest in the movie Out of Africa, played by Robert Redford.

Here are some the things that are part of my irritation with the book.

The main character, Beryl Markham, is a difficult person. Brought up with little family guidance, she makes her own rules, training horses, and later flying, when that was rarely done by women. She also has a very active sexual life, and wavers between completely owning that and being angry that defying the sexual conventions causes comments. By the end, I felt she was a very self-centered person, who didn't like dealing with the consequences of her actions

The book bursts the "Out of Africa" fantasy of a unique love between Karen Blixen and Dennys Finch Hatton. Markham was also a lover of Finch Hatton, and the book tells the story of the three friends in a way that makes Finch Hatton stubborn and fickle, and Blixen petty and small. This may all be true, but it can be hard to have one of your favorite myths burst.

In addition, there seems to be characters who change quickly, in a way is surprising. Markham's second husband goes from adoration to exasperation without much motivation. Since the story is told by Markham, perhaps she's just oblivious to other people's clues, but it leaves the reader feeling whiplashed.

I'm not sorry that I read this, but was left with a feeling of disappointment - I didn't like many of the characters by the end, and didn't feel interested or inspired by anything else that happened. But it feels like a very personal reaction, so I don't know if my opinion reflects what others' experiences might be.
