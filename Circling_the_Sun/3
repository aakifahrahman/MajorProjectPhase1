Lots and lots of meh...

I don't know what it is, but lately it seems like there have been a slew of historical fiction books put out that focus on a strong, historical woman, far ahead of her time and instead of focusing on her aspirations and on her accomplishments, these books are focused solely on her romantic relationships. Unfortunately, Circling the Sun was not the exception. It focused entirely too much on who Beryl bedded as opposed to the accomplishments that made her the woman she is.

The worst thing that can happen to me when reading is to finish reading the book and then immediately close it and think "Well, that was pointless." But that was the only thing I thought about Circling the Sun. It just meandered along at a sluggish pace without any hint of a journey in sight and on top of that, it was repetitive. In short, it was boring. I wasn't captivated by the plot (mainly because there wasn't one) nor any of the characters (seeing as how all they do is sleep with one another). The writing might have impressed me if I cared one whit about anything I was reading, but I didn't and so the writing that could be deemed as good was lost to dullness of it all.

Overall, I was highly unimpressed by Circling the Sun. If it would've focused more on Beryl's accomplishments, I might have liked it more. But instead, it focused on her romantic life, which wasn't all that interesting.
