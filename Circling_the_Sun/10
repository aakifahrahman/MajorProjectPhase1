The only interesting bit to me was the (brief) beginning, when she was a child running free with the local Kipsigis people. Otherwise, dull romance with no new historical settings or relationships. There are many better books about whites growing up in colonial Africa, e.g. The Flame Trees of Thika, or A Far Off Place.
