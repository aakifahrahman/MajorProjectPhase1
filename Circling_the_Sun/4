After reading West With the Night 30 years ago and several times since, I find Circling the Sun insulting. Yes, Beryl's love life was colorful but it shouldn't be the focus of her life. I think all the five stars are coming from readers who haven't read other, more factual accounts of her life. Half way through this book I began to feel cheated with all the trivial dialog and presumed thoughts of this substantial woman. Her achievements far out weigh this protrayal of her life. I do hope though, that this book will inspire the readers to read West With the Night and reach their own conclusions.
