I had heard so much about "The Paris Wife" that when I saw this book by Paula McLain, I decided to give it a try. I think I'll still try to pick up "The Paris Wife" but while McLain is a good writer who kept the narrative moving along (it was a well paced story), the character of Beryl Markham and the life and times in which she lived should have been more exciting but I never really felt much urgency during the story. Overall, Markham was a woman who got to do what she wanted in a time when women were fairly restricted, but it came off as almost dull. She had a bland first marriage; she had a bland first affair; the friends were all boinking each other; etc., etc., and then here comes Denys Finch Hatton who was as boring here as he seemed in Isak Dinesen's memoir.

The best thing about the story really is the pacing by McLain. It went so fast that I didn't not like it but on the other hand, I don't feel like I need to re-read either.
