I really wanted to like this book but the writing was so cumbersome - it just did not flow smoothly. I kept picking it up looking for some redeeming quality, but I finally gave up at page 75 and believe me, I usually stick with a book even if it's not great. Still not sure what most of the critics were raving about. I found it quite boring.
