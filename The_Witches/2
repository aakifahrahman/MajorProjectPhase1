Slogging through this out of pure stubbornness. The author's style is every bit as incomprehensible as most of the other reviews have stated. She's all over the place, and would do well to throw in a few more paragraph breaks, at least. If you're looking for something that'll give you some idea of the timeline of the events in Salem, look elsewhere. Narrative is pretty much nonexistent. Two stars for the occasional moment of clarity or insight.
