This writing is very hard to follow. I am 75 pages in and have been hoping the "readability" would improve since the beginning, but it has not. Many sentences have so much text between dashes that I constantly have to reread to remember the original point. This is such a shame because the research is thorough, but really this book is frustrating and trying. I am very disappointed.
