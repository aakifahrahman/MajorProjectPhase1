I purchased this book on the spur of the moment after reading about it somewhere on the internet. I never had a particular interest in the topic, but I am intersted in history. I was excessively disappointed from the very beginning. The writing is disjointed, and almost uncomprehendable. I had to pause at almost every paragraph to try to understand what the author was trying to relate. I reluctantly struggled though it optimistically hoping it would get better, but alas, it did not. It is clear the author did extensive research and had a good understanding of her topic, but her confusing style of writing is bewildering. When I finished with this book, I decided to see what I could find on the internet about the Salem witchcraft trials, and I feel I learned more from Wikipedia than from reading this book.
