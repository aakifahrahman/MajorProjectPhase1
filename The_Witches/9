"Their dark, however, was a very different dark. The sky over New England was crow-black, pitch-black, Bible black, so black it could be difficult at night to keep to the path, so black that a line of trees might migrate freely to another location or that you might find yourself pursued after nightfall by a rapid black hog, leaving you to crawl home." I challenge anyone to find any better examples of writing. Stacy Schiff takes me deeply into the world of Salem so I can see it and smell it and better understand why that witchy year of 1692 could happen. As she says so beautifully in her sumptuous book, "We have been conjuring with Salem-our national nightmare, the undercooked, overripe tabloid episode, the dystopian chapter in our past--ever since. It crackles, flickers, and jolts its way through American history and literature." A meticulous historian, she writes here an enduring work of literature as well. A big 5 stars for me.
