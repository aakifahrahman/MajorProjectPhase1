Finally! This is not a late-night goose-bump read. It is scholarly and done with respect to all parties, which are various. While there is a hint of blaming the young girls of falsely trying to get attention by making accusations, mainly the whole thing took on a life of its own, and ultimately had to also end on its own. Causes as diverse as weather, Indian raids, politics (local, with Boston, and with England), long-held feuds with neighbors over various claims, fear of the unknown, conflicting religious input and egos, and the stresses of living on the edge of the wilderness all played, and inter-played, a part. While well-researched it was a very readable book. But I'm glad that I did not live then and there.
