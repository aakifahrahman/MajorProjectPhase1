Salem Massachusetts was not the place to be in1692! The year saw nineteen people hanged (fourteen women and five men including clergy)
and two dogs hanged! The small village had less that six hundred inhabitants. Neighbors accused neighbors, husbands said their wives were witches and parish members turned on their pastors. Schiff examines:
a. The lives of the judges and accused persons including Increase Mather and his son Cotton who were famous New England Puritan preachers and theologians.
b. Schiff relates many details involved in the trials of the accused.
c. I felt the book went on way too long with a long list of people and cases which were hard to keep straight in the mind of the reader!
d. The rational explanations for the witchery are not adequately addressed by the author.
This book by a Pulitzer Prize winning historian should have been much better. The author has done tremendous research but her narrative is too abstruse for the general reader. OK!
